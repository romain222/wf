"Adafruit IO",2.0.0,"### The Internet of Things for Everyone

The Adafruit IO HTTP API provides access to your Adafruit IO data from any programming language or hardware environment that can speak HTTP. The easiest way to get started is with [an Adafruit IO learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/adafruit-io-basics) and [a simple Internet of Things capable device like the Feather Huzzah](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821).

This API documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages and is available at [https://github.com/adafruit/io-api](https://github.com/adafruit/io-api). For questions or comments visit the [Adafruit IO Forums](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewforum.php?f=56) or the [adafruit-io channel on the Adafruit Discord server](https://discord.gg/adafruit).

#### Authentication

Authentication for every API request happens through the `X-AIO-Key` header or query parameter and your IO API key. A simple cURL request to get all available feeds for a user with the username ""io_username"" and the key ""io_key_12345"" could look like this:

    $ curl -H ""X-AIO-Key: io_key_12345"" https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds

Or like this:

    $ curl ""https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds?X-AIO-Key=io_key_12345

Using the node.js [request](https://github.com/request/request) library, IO HTTP requests are as easy as:

```js
var request = require('request');

var options = {
  url: 'https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/io_username/feeds',
  headers: {
    'X-AIO-Key': 'io_key_12345',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
};

function callback(error, response, body) {
  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
    var feeds = JSON.parse(body);
    console.log(feeds.length + "" FEEDS AVAILABLE"");

    feeds.forEach(function (feed) {
      console.log(feed.name, feed.key);
    })
  }
}

request(options, callback);
```

#### Client Libraries

We have client libraries to help you get started with your project: [Python](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-python), [Ruby](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-ruby), [Arduino C++](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Arduino), [Javascript](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-io-node), and [Go](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-go) are available. They're all open source, so if they don't already do what you want, you can fork and add any feature you'd like.

"AWS CodePipeline",2015-07-09,"<fullname>AWS CodePipeline</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline is only configurable through the API. For additional information, see the <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html"">AWS CodePipeline User Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, gates, and transitions, as described below.</p> <p> <i>Pipelines</i> are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named, and consists of actions, gates, and stages. </p> <p>You can work with pipelines by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreatePipeline</a>, which creates a uniquely-named pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeletePipeline</a>, which deletes the specified pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns information about the pipeline structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name (ARN).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipelineExecution</a>, which returns information about a specific execution of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which returns information about the current state of the stages and actions of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListPipelines</a>, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated with your account.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListPipelineExecutions</a>, which gets a summary of the most recent executions for a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StartPipelineExecution</a>, which runs the the most recent revision of an artifact through the pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdatePipeline</a>, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the pipeline.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Pipelines include <i>stages</i>, which are logical groupings of gates and actions. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage will result in success or failure. If a stage fails, then the pipeline stops at that stage and will remain stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes action to re-run the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the structure of stages and actions, also refer to the <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html"">AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference</a>.</p> <p>Pipeline stages include <i>actions</i>, which are categorized into categories such as source or build actions performed within a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as <a>CreatePipeline</a> and <a>GetPipelineState</a>. </p> <p>Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage complete.</p> <p>You can work with transitions by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DisableStageTransition</a>, which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>EnableStageTransition</a>, which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline</b> </p> <p>For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. In order to integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers will need to work with the following items:</p> <p> <b>Jobs</b>, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source. </p> <p>You can work with jobs by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>AcknowledgeJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job,</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetJobDetails</a>, which returns the details of a job,</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PollForJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to act upon, </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure, and</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job success.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Third party jobs</b>, which are instances of an action created by a partner action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members of the AWS Partner Network.</p> <p>You can work with third party jobs by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job,</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetThirdPartyJobDetails</a>, which requests the details of a job for a partner action,</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PollForThirdPartyJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to act upon, </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure, and</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job success.</p> </li> </ul>","02-05-2017 07:59:53","28-11-2017 16:03:46"

The data collected by Application Discovery Service is securely retained in an Amazon-hosted and managed database in the cloud. You can export the data as a CSV or XML file into your preferred visualization tool or cloud-migration solution to plan your migration. For more information, see the Application Discovery Service <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/"">FAQ</a>.</p> <p>Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Agentless discovery</b> mode is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each host. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about software and software dependencies. It also doesn't work in non-VMware environments. We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments and if you want to collect information about software and software dependencies. You can also run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to quickly complete the initial infrastructure assessment and then install agents on select hosts to gather information about software and software dependencies.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Agent-based discovery</b> mode collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using Amazon software, the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center. The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an inventory of installed software applications, system and process performance, resource utilization, and network dependencies between workloads. The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Application Discovery Service integrates with application discovery solutions from AWS Partner Network (APN) partners.

"AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate",2016-11-01,"<fullname>AWS OpsWorks CM</fullname> <p> AWS OpsWorks for configuration management (CM) is a service that runs and manages configuration management servers. </p> <p> <b>Glossary of terms</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Server</b>: A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Engine</b>: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you want to use. Valid values in this release include <code>Chef</code> and <code>Puppet</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Backup</b>: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Events</b>: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Account attributes</b>: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.</p> <ul> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Throttling limits</b> </p> <p>All API operations allow for five requests per second with a burst of 10 requests per second.</p>","02-05-2017 07:59:53","05-12-2017 13:11:36"
"AWS Organizations",2016-11-28,"<fullname>AWS Organizations API Reference</fullname> <p>AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple AWS accounts into an <i>organization</i> and centrally manage your accounts and their resources.</p> <p>This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations API. For more information about using this service, see the <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html"">AWS Organizations User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>API Version</b> </p> <p>This version of the Organizations API Reference documents the Organizations API version 2016-11-28.</p> <note> <p>As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Organizations. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/tools/"">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Organizations. However, you also can use the Organizations Query API to make direct calls to the Organizations web service. To learn more about the Organizations Query API, see <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_query-requests.html"">Making Query Requests</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>. Organizations supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.</p> <p> <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>When you send HTTP requests to AWS, you must sign the requests so that AWS can identify who sent them. You sign requests with your AWS access key, which consists of an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not create an access key for your root account. Anyone who has the access key for your root account has unrestricted access to all the resources in your account. Instead, create an access key for an IAM user account that has administrative privileges. As another option, use AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials, and use those credentials to sign requests. </p> <p>To sign requests, we recommend that you use <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html"">Signature Version 4</a>. If you have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that require version 4 indicate this requirement. </p> <p>When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you with the access key that you specify when you configure the tools.</p> <p>In this release, each organization can have only one root. In a future release, a single organization will support multiple roots.</p> <p> <b>Support and Feedback for AWS Organizations</b> </p> <p>We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a href=""mailto:feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com"">feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com</a> or post your feedback and questions in the <a href=""http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219"">AWS Organizations support forum</a>. For more information about the AWS support forums, see <a href=""http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa"">Forums Help</a>.</p> <p> <b>Endpoint to Call When Using the CLI or the AWS API</b> </p> <p>For the current release of Organizations, you must specify the <code>us-east-1</code> region for all AWS API and CLI calls. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region:</p> <p> <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command:</p> <p> <code>aws configure set default.region us-east-1</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:</p> <p> <code>--region us-east-1</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>For the various SDKs used to call the APIs, see the documentation for the SDK of interest to learn how to direct the requests to a specific endpoint. For more information, see <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region"">Regions and Endpoints</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. </p> <p> <b>How examples are presented</b> </p> <p>The JSON returned by the AWS Organizations service as response to your requests is returned as a single long string without line breaks or formatting whitespace. Both line breaks and whitespace are included in the examples in this guide to improve readability. When example input parameters also would result in long strings that would extend beyond the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON text string.</p> <p> <b>Recording API Requests</b> </p> <p>AWS Organizations supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which requests were successfully made to Organizations, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Organizations and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_cloudtrail-integration.html"">Logging AWS Organizations Events with AWS CloudTrail</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>.

 You can also search for applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it, 
 configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks. </p><p>You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately
 within your team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the
 AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code. Along with the
 code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template.

Apacta,0.0.1,"API for a tool to craftsmen used to register working hours, material usage and quality assurance.    
# Endpoint
The endpoint `https://app.apacta.com/api/v1` should be used to communicate with the API. API access is only allowed with SSL encrypted connection (https).
# Authentication
URL query authentication with an API key is used, so appending `?api_key={api_key}` to the URL where `{api_key}` is found within Apacta settings is used for authentication
# Pagination
If the endpoint returns a `pagination` object it means the endpoint supports pagination - currently it's only possible to change pages with `?page={page_number}` but implementing custom page sizes are on the road map.


# Search/filter
Is experimental but implemented in some cases - see the individual endpoints' docs for further explanation.
# Ordering
Is currently experimental, but on some endpoints it's implemented on URL querys so eg. to order Invoices by `invoice_number` appending `?sort=Invoices.invoice_number&direction=desc` would sort the list descending by the value of `invoice_number`.
# Associations
Is currently implemented on an experimental basis where you can append eg. `?include=Contacts,Projects`  to the `/api/v1/invoices/` endpoint to embed `Contact` and `Project` objects directly.
# Project Files
Currently project files can be retrieved from two endpoints. `/projects/{project_id}/files` handles files uploaded from wall posts or forms. `/projects/{project_id}/project_files` allows uploading and showing files, not belonging to specific form or wall post.
# Errors/Exceptions
## 422 (Validation)
Write something about how the `errors` object contains keys with the properties that failes validation like:
```
  {
      ""success"": false,
      ""data"": {
          ""code"": 422,
          ""url"": ""/api/v1/contacts?api_key=5523be3b-30ef-425d-8203-04df7caaa93a"",
          ""message"": ""A validation error occurred"",
          ""errorCount"": 1,
          ""errors"": {
              ""contact_types"": [ ## Property name that failed validation
                  ""Contacts must have at least one contact type"" ## Message with further explanation
              ]
          }
      }

"Business Registries",0.0.6,"# Introduction
The Business Registries API is built on HTTP. The API is RESTful. It has predictable resource URIs.

  The API is documented in <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification"">OpenAPI</a> format.
  In addition to the standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few
  <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md"">vendor extensions</a>.

# Overview
The following sections describe the resources that make up the Business Registries REST API.
## Current Version
By default, all requests to https://api.abr.ato.gov.au receive the `v1` version of the REST API. We encourage you to explicitly request this version via the `Accept` header.

    Accept: application/vnd.abr-ato.v1+json

## Schema
All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from https://api.abr.ato.gov.au. All data is sent and received as JSON. Blank fields are included.

  All dates use the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format:

    YYYY-MM-DD

  For example: `2017-07-01` (the 1st of July 2017)

  All timestamps use the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

  For example: `2017-07-01T11:05:06+10:00`

## Timezones
Some requests allow for specifying timestamps or generate timestamps with time zone information. We apply the following rules, in order of priority, to determine timezone information for API calls.
### Explicitly provide an ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone information
For API calls that allow for a timestamp to be specified, we use that exact timestamp.

  For example: `2017-07-01T11:05:06+10:00`

## Pagination
Information about pagination is provided in the [Link](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#page-6) header.

  For example:

    Link: <https://api.abr.ato.gov.au/individuals?page=2>; rel=""next"",
          <https://api.abr.ato.gov.au/individuals?page=34>; rel=""last""

`rel=""next""` states that the next page is `page=2`. This makes sense, since by default, all paginated queries start at page `1`. `rel=""last""` provides some more information, stating that the last page of results is on `page 34`. Accordingly, we have 33 more pages of information that we can consume.
## Parameters
Many API methods take optional parameters:

    GET /individuals/1234/addresses/?addressType='Mailing'

In this example, the '1234' value is provided for the `:partyId` parameter in the path while `:addressType` is passed in the query string.
For POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE requests, parameters not included in the URL should be encoded as JSON with a Content-Type of 'application/json'.
## Metadata
The API provides **metadata services** that you can use to discover information about the classifcation schemes and values used by the Registry.

  For example:

    GET /classifications/roles

  Sample response:

    [

## Root Endpoint
You can issue a GET request to the root endpoint (also known as the service root) to get all the endpoint categories that the REST API supports:

    curl https://api.abr.ato.gov.au

## Authentication
The Business Registries API supports API Key authentication.

  When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key. You can generate additional API keys, and delete
  API keys (as you may need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the Business Registries API by
  providing your secret key in the request header.

  **Note:** Some requests will return `404 Not Found`, instead of `403 Permission Denied`. This is to prevent the
  accidental leakage of information to unauthorised users.

BigOven,partner,"#Documentation

This is the documentation for the partner endpoint of the BigOven Recipe and Grocery List API.

The update brings with it Swagger-based documentation. [Swagger](http://swagger.io) is an emerging standard for describing REST-based APIs, and with this Swagger-compliant endpoint (above), you can make ready-to-go interface libraries for your code via [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen). For instance, it's easy to generate libraries for Node.js, Java, Ruby, ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, php and more!

You can also try out the endpoint calls with your own api_key right here on this page. Be sure to enter your api_key above to use the ""Try it out!"" buttons on this page.

##Start Here

Developers new to the BigOven API should start with this version, not with the legacy API. We'll be making improvements to this API over time, and doing only bug fixes on the v1 API.



To pretend you're a BigOven user (for instance, to get your recently viewed recipes or your grocery list), you need to pass in Basic Authentication information in the header, just as with the v1 API. We do now require that you make all calls via https. You need to pass your api_key in with every call, though this can now be done on the header (send a request header ""X-BigOven-API-Key"" set to your api_key value, e.g., Request[""X-BigOven-API-Key""]=""your-key-here"".)

##Migration Notes

For existing partners, we encourage you to [migrate](http://api2.bigoven.com), and while at this writing we have no hard-and-fast termination date for the v1 API, we strongly prefer that you migrate by January 1, 2017. While the changes aren't overly complex, there are several breaking changes, including refactoring of recipe search and results and removal of support for XML. This is not a simply plug-and-play replacement to the v1 API. With respect to an exclusive focus on JSON, the world has spoken, and it prefers JSON for REST-based API's. We've taken numerous steps to refactor the API to make it more REST-compliant. Note that this v2 API will be the preferred API from this point onward, so we encourage developers to migrate to this new format. We have put together some [migration notes](/web/documentation/migration-to-v2) that we encourage you to read carefully.

"IBM Containers",3.0.0,"Containers are virtual software objects that include all the elements that an app needs to run. A container has the benefits of resource isolation and allocation but is more portable and efficient than, for example, a virtual machine.

 This documentation describes the IBM Containers API, which is based on the Docker Remote API. The API provides endpoints that you can use to create and manage your single containers and container groups in Bluemix. Endpoints are summarized under the following tags:

- **Authentication**: Retrieve and refresh your TLS certificates.
- **Private Docker images registry**: Create your own private Docker images registry in Bluemix by setting a namespace for your organization.
- **Images**: View, build, and push your images to your private Bluemix registry so you can use them with IBM Containers. You can also scan your container images with the Vulnerability Advisor against standard policies set by the organization manager and a database of known Ubuntu issues.
- **Single Containers**: Create and manage single containers in Bluemix. Use a single container to implement short-lived processes or to run simple tests as you develop an app or service. To make your single container available from the internet, review the `Public IP addresses` endpoints.
- **Container Groups**: Create and manage your container groups in Bluemix. A container group consists of multiple single containers that are all created from the same container image and as a consequence are configured in the same way. Container groups offer further options at no cost to make your app highly available. These options include in-built load balancing, auto-recovery of unhealthy container instances, and auto-scaling of container instances based on CPU and memory usage. Map a public route to your container group to make your app accessible from the internet.
- **Public IP addresses**: Use these endpoints to request public IP addresses for your space. You can bind this IP address to your container to make your container accessible from the internet.
- **File shares**: Create, list and delete file shares in a space. A file share is a NFS storage system that hosts Docker volumes.
- **Volumes**: Create and manage container volumes in your space to persist the data of your containers.


 Each API request requires an HTTP header that includes the 'X-Auth-Token’ and 'X-Auth-Project-Id’ parameter.

- **X-Auth-Token**: The JSON web token (JWT) that you receive when logging into the Bluemix platform. It allows you to use the IBM Containers REST API, access services, and resources. Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token information.
- **X-Auth-Project-Id**: The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with your containers. Run `cf space <space_name> --guid`, where `<space_name>` is the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.


 For further information about how containers work in the IBM Containers service, review the documentation under https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html.","13-02-2017 12:25:20","09-11-2017 17:09:18"

To access the API sign in with your Cisco CCO account at http://apiconsole.cisco.com and register an application
to recieve a client_id and a client_secret

You can then get your token using curl or any other method you prefer.

'curl -s -k -H ""Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"" -X POST -d ""client_id=<your_client_id>"" -d ""client_secret=<your_client_secret>"" -d ""grant_type=client_credentials"" https://cloudsso.cisco.com/as/token.oauth2'

You will receive an access token as demonstrated in the following example:
 '{""access_token"":""I7omWtBDAieSiUX3shOxNJfuy4J6"",""token_type"":""Bearer"",""expires_in"":3599}'

In Swagger, click on Change Authentication

enter the text ""I7omWtBDAieSiUX3shOxNJfuy4J6"" (which is the token you received)

then click on ""Try this operation""

"CORE API v2",2.0,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You can use the CORE API to access the 
    resources harvested and enriched by CORE. If you encounter any problems with the API, please <a href=""/contact"">report them to us</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The API is organised by resource type. The resources are <b>articles</b>, 
    <b>journals</b> and <b>repositories</b> and are represented using JSON data format. Furthermore, 
    each resource has a list of methods. The API also provides two global methods for accessing all resources at once.</p>

<h2>Response format</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Response for each query contains two fields: <b>status</b> and <b>data</b>.
    In case of an error status, the data field is empty. The data field contains a single object
    in case the request is for a specific identifier (e.g. CORE ID, CORE repository ID, etc.), or  
    contains a list of objects, for example for search queries. In case of batch requests, the response
    is an array of objects, each of which contains its own <b>status</b> and <b>data</b> fields.
    For search queries the response contains an additional field <b>totalHits</b>, which is the 
    total number of items which match the search criteria.</p>

<h2>Search query syntax</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify"">Complex search queries can be used in all of the API search methods.
    The query can be a simple string or it can be built using terms and operators described in Elasticsearch
    <a href=""http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax"">documentation</a>.
    The usable field names are <strong>title</strong>, <strong>description</strong>, <strong>fullText</strong>, 
    <strong>authorsString</strong>, <strong>publisher</strong>, <strong>repositories.id</strong>, <strong>repositories.name</strong>, 
    <strong>doi</strong>, <strong>oai</strong>, <strong>identifiers</strong> (which is a list of article identifiers including OAI, URL, etc.), <strong>language.name</strong> 
    and <strong>year</strong>. Some example queries:
</p>

<ul style=""margin-left: 30px;"">
    <li><p>title:psychology and language.name:English</p></li>
    <li><p>repositories.id:86 AND year:2014</p></li>
    <li><p>identifiers:""oai:aura.abdn.ac.uk:2164/3837"" OR identifiers:""oai:aura.abdn.ac.uk:2164/3843""</p></li>
    <li><p>doi:""10.1186/1471-2458-6-309""</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Retrieving the latest Articles</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify"">
    You can retrieve the harvested items since specific dates using the following queries:
</p>

<ul style=""margin-left: 30px;"">
    <li><p>repositoryDocument.metadataUpdated:>2017-02-10</p></li>
    <li><p>repositoryDocument.metadataUpdated:>2017-03-01 AND repositoryDocument.metadataUpdated:<2017-03-31</p></li>    
</ul>

<h2>Sort order</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For search queries, the results are ordered by relevance score. For batch 
    requests, the results are retrieved in the order of the requests.</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The API methods allow different parameters to be passed. Additionally, there is an API key parameter which is common to all API methods. For all API methods 
    the API key can be provided either as a query parameter or in the request header. If the API key 
    is not provided, the API will return HTTP 401 error. You can register for an API key <a href=""/services#api"">here</a>.</p>

# Tutorial for running the API in postman

First click on ""Run in Postman"" button
![postman - tutorial - 1](/Assets/images/api/postman-tutorial/postman-tutorial-1.png)

A new page will open.
Click on ""Postman for windows"" to run postman as a desktop app.
Make sure you have already [installed](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates) Postman.
![postman - tutorial - 2](/Assets/images/api/postman-tutorial/postman-tutorial-2.png)

In chrome an alert might show up to set a default app for opening postman links.
Click on ""Open Postman"".
![postman - tutorial - 3](/Assets/images/api/postman-tutorial/postman-tutorial-3.png)

The OpenAPI specification will be imported in Postman as a new collection named ""Envoice api""
![postman - tutorial - 4](/Assets/images/api/postman-tutorial/postman-tutorial-4.png)

When testing be sure to check and modify the environment variables to suit your api key and secret.
The domain is set to envoice's endpoint so you don't really need to change that.

![postman - tutorial - 6](/Assets/images/api/postman-tutorial/postman-tutorial-6.png)

You don't need to change the values of the header parameters, because they will be replaced automatically when you send a request with real values from the environment configured in the previous step.
![postman - tutorial - 7](/Assets/images/api/postman-tutorial/postman-tutorial-7.png)

"Geneea Natural Language Processing",1.0,"<div class=""api-description"">
    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <p>For all calls, supply your API key. <a href=""https://www.geneea.com/pricing"">Sign up to <em>obtain the key</em></a>.</p>
    <p>
        Our API supports both <em>unencrypted (HTTP)</em> and <em>encrypted (HTTPS)</em> protocols.
        However, for security reasons, we strongly encourage using only the encrypted version.
    </p>
    <p>The API key should be supplied as either a request parameter <code>user_key</code> or in <code>Authorization</code> header.</p>
    <pre><code>Authorization: user_key &lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>API operations</h2>
    <p>
        All API operations can perform analysis on supplied raw text or on text extracted from a given URL.
        Optionally, one can supply additional information which can make the result more precise. An example
        of such information would be the language of text or a particular text extractor for URL resources.
    </p>
    <p>The supported types of analyses are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>lemmatization</strong> &longrightarrow;
            Finds out lemmata (basic forms) of all the words in the document.
        </li>
        <li><strong>correction</strong> &longrightarrow;
            Performs correction (diacritization) on all the words in the document.
        </li>
        <li><strong>topic detection</strong> &longrightarrow;
            Determines a topic of the document, e.g. finance or sports.
        </li>
        <li><strong>sentiment analysis</strong> &longrightarrow;
            Determines a sentiment of the document, i.e. how positive or negative the document is.
        </li>
        <li><strong>named entity recognition</strong> &longrightarrow;
            Finds named entities (like person, location, date etc.) mentioned the the document.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Encoding</h2>
    <p>The supplied text is expected to be in UTF-8 encoding, this is especially important for non-english texts.</p>

    <h2>Returned values</h2>
    <p>The API calls always return objects in serialized JSON format in UTF-8 encoding.</p>
    <p>
        If any error occurs, the HTTP response code will be in the range <code>4xx</code> (client-side error) or
        <code>5xx</code> (server-side error). In this situation, the body of the response will contain information
        about the error in JSON format, with <code>exception</code> and <code>message</code> values.
    </p>

    <h2>URL limitations</h2>
    <p>
        All the requests are semantically <code>GET</code>. However, for longer texts, you may run into issues
        with URL length limit. Therefore, it's possible to always issue a <code>POST</code> request with all
        the parameters encoded as a JSON in the request body.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre><code>
        POST /s1/sentiment
        Content-Type: application/json

        {""text"":""There is no harm in being sometimes wrong - especially if one is promptly found out.""}
    </code></pre>
    <p>This is equivalent to <code>GET /s1/sentiment?text=There%20is%20no%20harm...</code></p>

    <h2>Request limitations</h2>
    <p>
        The API has other limitations concerning the size of the HTTP requests. The maximum allowed size of any
        POST request body is <em>512 KiB</em>. For request with a URL resource, the maximum allowed number of
        extracted characters from each such resource is <em>100,000</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>
        By using the API, you agree to our
        <a href=""https://www.geneea.com/terms.html"" target=""_blank"">Terms of Service Agreement</a>.

# Base URL


All URLs referenced in the documentation have the following base:


```
https://api.link.fish
```


The REST API is only served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.


# Authentication
HTTP requests to the REST API are protected with [HTTP Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). You will use the email address of your link.fish account as the username and your API access token as the password for HTTP Basic authentication.

If you do not have an account yet, go to [https://link.fish/api](https://link.fish/api) and create one first.

You will receive the API access token automatically via email after you signed up. To generate a new token and invalidate the current one log into your link.fish  account at [https://app.link.fish](https://app.link.fish) and go to: ""Plugins"" -> ""API Dashboard""

There you can also see how many credits you used already.


# Errors
The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:
```
{

  ""status"": {HTTP STATUS CODE}
  ""message"": ""{ERROR MESSAGE}""
}
```
Like for example when the authorization is not provided or wrong:
```
{

  ""status"": 401
  ""message"": ""Unauthorized""
}
```

# Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find it in the response headers, under X-LF-Request-Id. In case you have problems please provide this identifier that we can help you as good and fast as possible.


Example:
```
X-LF-Request-Id: f7f0036f-5277-421a-b143-f7a151571d18
```


# Item format

The data is by default deeply nested. So if it should be checked if there is an offer with a price, the whole tree has to be checked. To make that simpler, it is also possible to return the data ""flat"". If selected it will flatten the tree by copying all the data to the main level under a property with the name of its type and link the data internally.

Information: We created a node module which allows converting between the two formats. It did not get open sourced yet. If you are in need, simply contact us via api@link.fish.


# Response Content Type
By default, all data gets returned as JSON. If the data should be returned as XML add the following header:

```
Accept: application/xml
```

# Credits

Depending on the request made a different amount of credits get charged. How many which request costs can be found on the [API pricing page](http://link.fish/api/#pricing). Additionally, does a  header named ""X-LF-Credits-Charged"" get added to each successful response with the amount of credits charged.

Example:
```
X-LF-Credits-Charged: 1
```
You can check anytime how many credits you did use already by logging into your link.fish  account at [https://app.link.fish](https://app.link.fish) and checking under:  ""Plugins"" -> ""API Dashboard""


If you have problems, questions or improvement advice please send us an email to api@link.fish

# Get Started

If you use [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com) or similar program which can operate with swagger`s files - just [download](https://docs.openfintech.io) our spec and [import it](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/importing_swagger). Also you can try live [API demo](https://api.openfintech.io).

## Overview

The OpenFinTech API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.<br>
API is based on [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) standard. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors, although our API libraries convert responses to appropriate language-specific objects.<br>
JSON API requires use of the JSON API media type (`application/vnd.api+json`) for exchanging data.<br>
### Additional Request Headers
#### ACCEPT HEADER
Your requests should always include the header:
```curl
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
```

## Authentication

To use OpenFinTech API no needed authorization.

## Versioning

When we make changes to the API, we release new, dated versions. The current version is **2017-08-24**. Read our [API upgrades guide]() to see our API changelog and to learn more about backwards compatibility.

## Pagination

OpenFinTech APIs to retrieve lists of banks, currencies and other resources - paginated to **100** items by default. The pagination information will be included in the list API response under the node name `meta` - contains information about listed objects [`total` - contains information about total count of listed objects, `pages` - count of pages], `links` - contain links to navigate between pages [`first` - link to first page, `prev` - link to previous page, `next` - link to next page, `last` - link to last page].<br>
By default first page will be listed. For navigating through pages, use the page parameter (e.g. `page[number]`, `page[size]`).<br>
The `page[size]` parameter can be used to set the number of records that you want to receive in the response.<br>
The `page[number]` parameter can be used to set needed page number.<br>
Example of response:
```json
{
  ""meta"": {
    ""total"": 419,
    ""pages"": 42
  },
  ""links"": {
    ""first"": ""/v1/{path}?page[number]=1&page[size]=10"",
    ""prev"": ""/v1/{path}?page[number]=39&page[size]=10"",
    ""next"": ""/v1/{path}?page[number]=41&page[size]=10"",
    ""last"": ""/v1/{path}?page[number]=42&page[size]=10""
  }
```

### Sorting

OpenFinTech\`s API supported query parameter to sort result collection [e.g. `?sort=code`]. Information about available parameters may be found in the endpoint description. Positive parameter [e.g. `?sort=code`] points to ascending sorting, negative  [e.g. `?sort=-code`] - to descending sorting. Also, supported multiple sorting parameters [e.g. `?sort=code, -name, id`, etc.]
```curl
https://api.openfintech.io/v1/countries?sort=name,-area
```

### Filtering

Filtering provided by unique query key `filter[*filtering_condition*]`. Information about available parameters may be found in the endpoint description.
```curl
https://api.openfintech.io/v1/countries?filter[region]=europe
```

## Images

OpenFinTech provides two types of images: icons and logos. To get one of those types you should to use next url pattern:
``` curl
https://api.openfintech.io/v1/{path}/{id}/{icon/logo}
```
Also, images can be resized by adding next parameters: `h={height}&w={width}`. For example, you want to get organization icon with width equals to 20 pixels:
``` curl
https://api.openfintech.io/v1/organizations/{id}/icon?w=20&h=20
```
If argument height or width is missing API returns original image with real sizes.

## Errors

API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, etc.), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with OpenFinTech's servers (these are rare).

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 200 - OK	| Everything worked as expected. |
| 400 - Bad Request |	The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |
| 401 - Unauthorized |	No valid API key provided. |
| 402 - Request Failed	| The parameters were valid but the request failed. |
| 404 - Not Found |	The requested resource doesn't exist. |
| 409 - Conflict	| The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key). |
| 429 - Too Many Requests |	Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |
| 500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors |	Something went wrong on OpenFinTech's end. (These are rare.) |

"Open Targets Platform",3.0.1,"### The Open Targets Platform REST API

The Open Targets Platform API ('Application Programming Interface')
allows programmatic retrieval of our data via a set of
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
services.

You can make calls to the latest version of our API using the base URL
 `https://api.opentargets.io/v3/platform`. Please make sure you use `https` instead of the unencrypted
 `http` calls, which we do not accept. Note that we only serve the latest version of the API. If you are interested in querying
 an old version, please [get in touch](mailto:support@targetvalidation.org) so that we can help.

We list below the methods available for you to query our data directly from the API. These methods will be
automatically generated from our Swagger UI. For every request you create, the interface will display a [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) command
that you can copy and paste directly to a shell to obtain the same results without using an internet browser.

Check our [API blog posts](https://blog.opentargets.org/tag/api), for tutorials and additional
information on how to access of our data programmatically.

### Available Methods

The available methods can be grouped in four types:

* __public__ - Methods that serve the core set of our data. These are stable and we fully supported them.
* __private__ - Methods used by the web app to serve additional data not specific to our platform. These methods
may change without notice and should be used with caution.
* __utils__ - Methods to get statistics and technical data about our API.
* __auth__ - Methods used for authentication. These are only relevant if you have an API key (see the 'Fair Usage
and API keys' section below for more details).

### Supported formats

The four methods above are all available via a `GET` request, and will serve outputs as `JSON`.
Alternative output formats such `xml`, `csv` and `tab` are also available for some of the methods.
Please note that alternative output formats are not supported in this interactive page. The response here will always be in `json` format.

If you have complex queries with large number of parameters, you should
use a `POST` request instead of  `GET`. `POST` methods require a body encoded as `json`.
When querying for a specific disease using the latest version of the API, your call would look like the example below:

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{""disease"":[""EFO_0000253""]}' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' https://api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/public/evidence/filter
```
### How to interpret a response

Each HTTP response will serve data in headers and body.
The headers will give you details about your query, such as how long it took to run, and how much usage you have left (See the 'Fair Usage
and API keys' section below for more details).

In the body of the response, you will find the data you have requested for in a `json` format. The
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) program is a useful tool to parse the json response while on the command line.

```sh
curl https://api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/public/association/filter\?target\=ENSG00000157764 | jq
```

We do not analyse the nature of any specific API queries except for the purposes of improving the performance of our API.
Read more in our [privacy section](https://www.targetvalidation.org/terms_of_use#privacy).

How can we make the Open Targets Platform API more useful to you? Would you like additional methods to be implemented?
Please [get in touch](mailto:support@targetvalidation.org) and send your suggestions.

### More examples
Check our [Getting started tutorial](https://blog.opentargets.org/api-getting-started-1) for more
examples on how to use the API and for some code snippets, which can be used to construct more complex queries.

# Overview

Paylocity Web Services API is an externally facing RESTful Internet protocol. The Paylocity API uses HTTP verbs and a RESTful endpoint structure. OAuth 2.0 is used as the API Authorization framework. Request and response payloads are formatted as JSON.
Paylocity supports v1 and v2 versions of its API endpoints. v1, while supported, won't be enhanced with additional functionality. For direct link to v1 documentation, please click [here](https://docs.paylocity.com/weblink/guides/Paylocity_Web_Services_API/v1/Paylocity_Web_Services_API.htm). For additional resources regarding v1/v2 differences and conversion path, please contact vendorrelations@paylocity.com.

##### Setup

Paylocity will provide the secure client credentials and set up the scope (type of requests and allowed company numbers). You will receive the unique client id, secret, and Paylocity public key for the data encryption. The secret will expire in 365 days. 
* Paylocity will send you an e-mail 10 days prior to the expiration date for the current secret. If not renewed, the second e-mail notification will be sent 5 days prior to secret's expiration. Each email will contain the code necessary to renew the client secret. 
* You can obtain the new secret by calling API endpoint using your current not yet expired credentials and the code that was sent with the notification email. For details on API endpoint, please see Client Credentials section. 
* Both the current secret value and the new secret value will be recognized during the transition period. After the current secret expires, you must use the new secret. 
* If you were unable to renew the secret via API endpoint, you can still contact Service and they will email you new secret via secure email.


When validating the request, Paylocity API will honor the defaults and required fields set up for the company default New Hire Template as defined in Web Pay.


# Authorization

Paylocity Web Services API uses OAuth2.0 Authentication with JSON Message Format.


All requests of the Paylocity Web Services API require a bearer token which can be obtained by authenticating the client with the Paylocity Web Services API via OAuth 2.0.


The client must request a bearer token from the authorization endpoint:


auth-server for production: https://api.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token


auth-server for testing: https://apisandbox.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token

##### Authorization Header

The request is expected to be in the form of a basic authentication request, with the ""Authorization"" header containing the client-id and client-secret. This means the standard base-64 encoded user:password, prefixed with ""Basic"" as the value for the Authorization header, where user is the client-id and password is the client-secret.

##### Content-Type Header

The ""Content-Type"" header is required to be ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"".

##### Additional Values

The request must post the following form encoded values within the request body:

    grant_type = client_credentials
    scope = WebLinkAPI

##### Responses

Success will return HTTP 200 OK with JSON content:

    {
      ""access_token"": ""xxx"",
      ""expires_in"": 3600,
      ""token_type"": ""Bearer""
    }

# Encryption

Paylocity uses a combination of RSA and AES cryptography. As part of the setup, each client is issued a public RSA key.

Paylocity recommends the encryption of the incoming requests as additional protection of the sensitive data. Clients can opt-out of the encryption during the initial setup process. Opt-out will allow Paylocity to process un-encrypted requests.

The Paylocity Public Key has the following properties:

* 2048 bit key size

* PKCS1 key format

* PEM encoding

##### Properties

* key (base 64 encoded): The AES symmetric key encrypted with the Paylocity Public Key. It is the key used to encrypt the content. Paylocity will decrypt the AES key using RSA decryption and use it to decrypt the content.

* iv (base 64 encoded): The AES IV (Initialization Vector) used when encrypting the content.

* content (base 64 encoded): The AES encrypted request. The key and iv provided in the secureContent request are used by Paylocity for decryption of the content.

We suggest using the following for the AES:

* CBC cipher mode

* PKCS7 padding

* 128 bit block size

* 256 bit key size

##### Sample Example

Rebilly,2.1,"# Introduction
The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
and [Javascript](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-js-sdk).

We have other APIs that are also available.  Every action from our [app](https://app.rebilly.com)
is supported by an API which is documented and available for use so that you
may automate any workflows necessary.  This document contains the most commonly
integrated resources.

# Authentication
When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
public key.
- private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
- JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
- public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
your secret keys.

Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

# PHP SDK
For all PHP SDK examples provided in this spec you will need to configure `$client`.
You may do it like this:

```php
$client = new Rebilly\Client([
    'apiKey' => 'YourApiKeyHere',
    'baseUrl' => 'https://api.rebilly.com',
]);
```

Receptive,1.0.0,"## Who is this for?

This documentation is for developers creating their own integration with [Receptive's](https://www.receptive.io) API. If you are doing a standard integration, there's a really easy [Javascript integration](https://help.receptive.io/hc/en-us/articles/209221969-How-to-integrate-Receptive-with-your-app) that you should know about before you go to the effort of building your own integration.

## Authentication

API calls generally need to be authenticated. Generate an API Key at https://receptive.io/app/#/vendor/settings?section=integrate. This key should then be added to every request URL as a query parameter named 'auth-token'

## Endpoint

API endpoint is https://api.eu-west-1.receptive.io.
## Notes

API endpoints are being added to this documentation as needed by customers. If you don't see an endpoint you need please contact support and if it exists we'll publish the docs here. The 'try it out' feature on this documentation page will probably be blocked by your browser because the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header has its value set by the Receptive server depending on your hostname.

## Generating client code

This documentation is automatically generated from an OpenAPI spec available [here](http://apidoc.receptive.io/receptive.swagger.json). You can use Swagger to auto-generate API client code in many languages using the [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/)","28-02-2018 22:02:25","28-02-2018 22:02:25"

Authentication uses standard OAuth 2.0 process

##Getting started

1. Sign up for [RiteKit](https://ritekit.com/)

1. Go to [developer dashboard](https://ritekit.com/developer/dashboard/)

1. Click ""Create a token"" button to get your **Client ID** and **Client secret**

1. Study the documentation below (for more info on oAuth go to http://oauth.net/)

1. When you reach your free limit of calls per month, [upgrade to paid tiers](https://ritekit.com/developer/)

## Options for authorizing API Calls

#### A) Using Client ID directly

You can directly connect to our API using your **client ID** by sending it as a GET query parameter. This option is simple (no need for oAuth) but it should be used only in case the Client ID is not exposed publicly.

GET  https://api.ritekit.com/v1/stats/multiple-hashtags?tags=php?client_id=292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a

#### B) Using Access token (oAuth 2.0)

Once you have valid Access token, you can access our API by sending the token in the Authorization header bearer or as a query Access token. See the oAuth 2.0 section to learn how to get Access token and keep refreshing it.

Authorization: Bearer xxxx

Or

GET  https://api.ritekit.com/v1/stats/multiple-hashtags?tags=php?access_token=292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a

"ShipStation Developer Portal",1.0.0,"# Integrating with ShipStation

ShipStation strives to streamline shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online. We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. 
As a result, we’ve worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/) and we’ll get in touch.

There are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:

* Custom Store Integration

* ShipStation API

## Custom Store Integration

Looking for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform? The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin. It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click, in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking information 
updates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created. It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless experience.

The Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:

* Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products, customers, etc.

* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped, including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more

To integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide. 
We refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces like eBay and Amazon.

**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration, click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**

## ShipStation API

Our API is available for any plan, and allows for read access to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects, like Orders, Customers, and Products. 
The API is a great way to get data directly to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).

**This API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**

+ Managing Orders

+ Managing Shipments

+ Creating Shipping Labels

+ Retrieving Shipping Rates

+ and more!!!

**To learn more about our API, please review our API documentation below.**

## Which one should I pick?

The method that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull* order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation, ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these 2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing orders 
and sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation, as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.

An API integration, on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using our ""/orders/CreateOrder"" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform functions such as tagging an order, 
shipping an order, creating a shipping label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web app.

### Considerations

* **Will your integration be the main order management tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality may be the best option.

* **Would you like your store integration to be a branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in the app,
as well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.

# ShipStation API Requirements

## End Point

Endpoints are located at the following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.

## Authentication

The ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.  You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .

The Authorization header is constructed as follows:

+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``) are combined into a string ""username:password""

+ The resulting string is then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to 76 char/line

+ The authorization method and a space i.e. ""Basic "" is then put before the encoded string.

For example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation' and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:

+ Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=

## API Rate Limits

In an effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability, we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined below:

**Response Headers**

All responses will include headers with status information about rate limiting.

1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number of requests per minute to the endpoint

2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available requests remaining in the current window

3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number of seconds remaining until the next window begins

**Hitting the Limit**

If your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this body:

```
{
    ""message"": ""Too Many Requests""
}
```

And these headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:

```
{
    ""X-Rate-Limit-Limit"": 60,
    ""X-Rate-Limit-Remaining"": 0,
    ""X-Rate-Limit-Reset"": 20
}
```

When the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and Secret is 40 requests per minute.

If you have any issues with the API, please email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>

## Server Responses

Status Code | Description
------------|-------------
``200`` | OK - The request was successful (some API calls may return 201 instead).
``201`` | Created - The request was successful and a resource was created.
``204`` | No Content - The request was successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is empty).
``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.
``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.
``403`` | Forbidden - Access denied.
``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.
``405`` | Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.

SimplyRETS,1.0.0,"The SimplyRETS API is an exciting step towards making it easier for
developers and real estate agents to build something awesome with
real estate data!

The documentation below makes live requests to our API using the
trial data. To get set up with the API using live MLS data, you
must have RETS credentials from your MLS, which you can then use to
create an app with SimplyRETS. For more information on that
process, please see our [FAQ](https://simplyrets.com/faq), [Getting
Started](https://simplyrets.com/blog/getting-set-up.html) page, or
[contact us](https://simplyrets.com/\#home-contact).

Below you'll find the API endpoints, query parameters, response bodies,
and other information about using the SimplyRETS API. You can run
queries by clicking the 'Try it Out' button at the bottom of each
section.

### Authentication
The SimplyRETS API uses Basic Authentication. When you create an
app, you'll get a set of API credentials to access your
listings. If you're trying out the test data, you can use
`simplyrets:simplyrets` for connecting to the API.

### Media Types
The SimplyRETS API uses the `Accept` header to allow clients to
control media types (content versions). We maintain backwards
compatibility with API clients by allowing them to specify a
content version. We highly recommend setting and explicity media
type when your application reaches production. Both the structure
and content of our API response bodies is subject to change so we
can add new features while respecting the stability of applications
which have already been developed.

To always use the latest SimplyRETS content version, simply use
`application/json` in your application `Accept` header.

If you want to pin your clients media type to a specific version,
you can use the vendor-specific SimplyRETS media type, e.g.
`application/vnd.simplyrets-v0.1+json""`

To view all valid content-types for making an `OPTIONS`, make a
request to the SimplyRETS api root

`curl -XOPTIONS -u simplyrets:simplyrets https://api.simplyrets.com/`

The default media types used in our API responses may change in the
future. If you're building an application and care about the
stability of the API, be sure to request a specific media type in the
Accept header as shown in the examples below.

The wordpress plugin automatically sets the `Accept` header for the
compatible SimplyRETS media types.

### Pagination

To paginate through listings, start your query with these
parameters: 'limit=500&lastId=0'. The 'lastId' is the important
part, you can use any limit up to 500. When you receive the
response from the API with the results, check the 'Link' header for
the 'next' link. That link is pre-built to access the next 'page'
of listings. Alternatively, you can use the last listing's 'mlsId'
from the previous request and use that in the next query. For
example:

First query:

curl -u username:password 'https://api.simplyrets.com/properties?limit=500&lastId=0'

If the 'mlsId' in the last listing of the results is '1234567', then the next query will be:

curl -u username:password 'https://api.simplyrets.com/properties?limit=500&lastId=1234567'

...and so one until you have reached the final page of listings.

There a few pieces of useful information about each request stored
in the HTTP Headers:

- `X-Total-Count` shows you the total amount of listings that match
  your current query.
- `Link` contains pre-built pagination links for accessing the next
'page' of listings that match your query.

### RETS Vendor Compliance

Many RETS vendors have strict requirements for showing disclaimers
with specific information embedded. For example, in many areas it's
required to show the time of the last listing refresh inside the
disclaimer.

The timestamp of the last listing refresh timestamp can be found in
one of two spots:

- The `X-SimplyRETS-LastUpdate` header from `GET /properties` or `GET /properties/{mlsId}`

- Calling the API root `/` or properties api endpoint `/properties`
  with an OPTIONS request

  - `OPTIONS /`

    Using this route, you can see the timestamp for all RETS
    vendors associated with your account.

  - `OPTIONS /properties`

"TheTVDB API v2",2.1.2,"API v2 targets v1 functionality with a few minor additions. The API is accessible via https://api.thetvdb.com and provides the following REST endpoints in JSON format.


How to use this API documentation
----------------


You may browse the API routes without authentication, but if you wish to send requests to the API and see response data, then you must authenticate.
1. Obtain a JWT token by `POST`ing  to the `/login` route in the `Authentication` section with your API key and credentials.
1. Paste the JWT token from the response into the ""JWT Token"" field at the top of the page and click the 'Add Token' button.


You will now be able to use the remaining routes to send requests to the API and get a response.


Language Selection
----------------


Language selection is done via the `Accept-Language` header. At the moment, you may only pass one language abbreviation in the header at a time. Valid language abbreviations can be found at the `/languages` route..


Authentication
----------------


Authentication to use the API is similar to the How-to section above. Users must `POST` to the `/login` route with their API key and credentials in the following format in order to obtain a JWT token.

`{""apikey"":""APIKEY"",""username"":""USERNAME"",""userkey"":""USERKEY""}`

Note that the username and key are ONLY required for the `/user` routes. The user's key is labled `Account Identifier` in the account section of the main site.
The token is then used in all subsequent requests by providing it in the `Authorization` header. The header will look like: `Authorization: Bearer <yourJWTtoken>`. Currently, the token expires after 24 hours. You can `GET` the `/refresh_token` route to extend that expiration date.


Versioning
----------------


You may request a different version of the API by including an `Accept` header in your request with the following format: `Accept:application/vnd.thetvdb.v$VERSION`. This documentation automatically uses the version seen at the top and bottom of the page.","09-11-2015 22:55:27","05-02-2018 07:13:13"

  - Get quotes for shipping methods with the /order/shipping endpoint
  - Get a quote for an order with the /order/create endpoint
  - Confirm the order with the /order/confirm endpoint

Uploaded models and orders can be retrieved either in bulk or by id at the /model and /order endpoints, respectively.

In some cases, you may wish to get a quote for a specific model without the context of an order. In this case, you may use the /model/quote (if you've already uploaded the model to the API) or the /model/quote_attrs (lets you quote based on calculated model attributes) endpoints.

It is used by many William Hill services. <br /> Note: all requests must be executed over HTTPS and include an API key and secret.<br /><br /><br /> <b>Authentication Ticket Expiration Times</b><br /><br /> When a customer is logged in using the Sessions API, they are given an Authentication Ticket; using this ticket on subsequent API requests gives you access to account activities (such as placing a bet, deposits, etc). However, this ticket is only valid for a given period of time depending on how it is used. If the ticket is used and then has a period of inactivity longer than 7,200 seconds (2 hours), then the ticket will expire and further requests using the ticket will be denied - in effect, a customer has been logged out and will need to authenticate again. <br /><br /><br /> Normally, any ticket issued only has a maximum life expectancy of 28,000 seconds (8 hours) after which it can no longer be used, even if it has been used regularly. The customer again will be effectively logged out and will need to authenticate again. If you wish to avoid this, you need to set the query parameter extended to Y, which will enable your application to generate a ticket valid for 60 days without expiring due to inactivity. <br />","26-11-2017 16:51:11","19-02-2018 08:08:39"

# About the REST API

The Wowza Streaming Cloud<sup>TM</sup> REST API (application programming interface) offers complete programmatic control over live streams, transcoders, stream sources, and stream targets. Anything you can do in the Wowza Streaming Cloud UI can also be achieved by making HTTP-based requests to cloud-based servers through the REST API.

The Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API features *cross-origin resource sharing*, or CORS.
CORS is a [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) that provides headers in HTTP requests to enable a web server to safely make a network request to another domain.

In order to protect shared resources, the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API is subject to limits. For details, see [Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API limits](https://www.wowza.com/docs/wowza-streaming-cloud-rest-api-limits).
# About this documentation
This reference documentation is based on the open-source [Swagger framework](http://swagger.io/specification/).
It allows you to view the operations, parameters, and request and reponse schemas for every resource. Request samples are presented in cURL (Shell) and JavaScript; some samples also include just the JSON object. Response samples are all JSON.

For more information and examples on using the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API, see our [library of Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API technical articles](https://www.wowza.com/docs/wowza-streaming-cloud-rest-api).

# Query requirements
The Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API uses HTTP requests to retrieve data from cloud-based servers. Requests must contain proper JSON, two authentication keys, and the correct version number in the base path.

## JSON
The Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API uses the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/) to request and return data. This means requests must include the header `Content-Type: application/json` and must include a single resource object in JSON format as primary data.

Responses include HTTP status codes that indicate whether the query was successful. If there was an error, a description explains the problem so that you can fix it and try again.

## Authentication
Requests to the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API must be authenticated with two keys: an API key and an access key. Each key is a 64-character alphanumeric string that you can find on the **API Access** page in Wowza Streaming Cloud.

Use the `wsc-api-key` and `wsc-access-key` headers to authenticate requests, like this (in cURL):

```bash
curl -H 'wsc-api-key: [64-character-api-key-goes-here]' -H 'wsc-access-key: [64-character-access-key-goes-here]'
```

<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

## Version
The Wowza Streaming Cloud API is currently at version 1.0.0. Use `v1` in your base path in every request, like this path to the live_streams endpoint:
```
https://api.cloud.wowza.com/api/v1/live_streams
```
## Example query
Here is a complete example POST request, in cURL, with proper JSON syntax, headers, authentication, and version information:
```bash
curl -H 'wsc-api-key: [64-character-api-key-goes-here]' -H 'wsc-access-key: [64-character-access-key-goes-here]'
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{
    ""live_stream"": {
      ""name"": ""My live Stream"",
      ""..."": ""...""
    }
  }' https://api.cloud.wowza.com/api/v1/live_streams

# Introduction
Welcome to the reference for the Zuora REST API!

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST_API"" target=""_blank"">REST</a> is a web-service protocol that lends itself to rapid development by using everyday HTTP and JSON technology.

The Zuora REST API provides a broad set of operations and resources that:

  * Enable Web Storefront integration from your website.
  * Support self-service subscriber sign-ups and account management.
  * Process revenue schedules through custom revenue rule models.
  * Enable manipulation of most objects in the Zuora Object Model.
  
  ## Endpoints
  
  The Zuora REST API is provided via the following endpoints.
  | Tenant              | Base URL for REST Endpoints |
  |-------------------------|-------------------------|
  |US Production | https://rest.zuora.com   |
  |US API Sandbox    | https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com|
  |US Performance Test | https://rest.pt1.zuora.com |
  |EU Production | https://rest.eu.zuora.com |
  |EU Sandbox | https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com |
  
  The production endpoint provides access to your live user data. The API Sandbox tenant is a good place to test your code without affecting real-world data. To use it, you must be provisioned with an API Sandbox tenant - your Zuora representative can help you if needed.
  
  ## Access to the API
  
  If you have a Zuora tenant, you already have access to the API.
  
  If you don't have a Zuora tenant, go to <a href=""
https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive"" target=""_blank"">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data, such as a sample product catalog.

We recommend that you <a href=""https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User"" target=""_blank"">create an API user</a> specifically for making API calls. Don't log in to the Zuora UI with this account. Logging in to the UI enables a security feature that periodically expires the account's password, which may eventually cause authentication failures with the API. Note that a user role does not have write access to Zuora REST services unless it has the API Write Access permission as described in those instructions.


# API Changelog

# Authentication

## OAuth v2.0

Zuora recommends that you use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate to the Zuora REST API. Currently, OAuth is not available in every environment. See [Zuora Testing Environments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Environments) for more information.

Authenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:
1. Create a Client
2. Generate a Token

### Create a Client

You must first [create an OAuth client](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users#Create_an_OAuth_Client_for_a_User) in the Zuora UI. To do this, you must be an administrator of your Zuora tenant. This is a one-time operation. You will be provided with a Client ID and a Client Secret. Please note this information down, as it will be required for the next step.

**Note:** The OAuth client will be owned by a Zuora user account. If you want to perform PUT, POST, or DELETE operations using the OAuth client, the owner of the OAuth client must have a Platform role that includes the ""API Write Access"" permission.

### Generate a Token

After creating a client, you must make a call to obtain a bearer token using the [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) operation. This operation requires the following parameters:
- `client_id` - the Client ID displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step
- `client_secret` - the Client Secret displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step
- `grant_type` - must be set to `client_credentials`

**Note**: The Client ID and Client Secret mentioned above were displayed when you created the OAuth Client in the prior step. The [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) response specifies how long the bearer token is valid for. Call [Generate an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken) again to generate a new bearer token.

For every subsequent API request, a valid bearer token must be provided in an HTTP header:

`Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}`




## Other Supported Authentication Schemes

Zuora continues to support the following additional legacy means of authentication:

  * Use username and password. Include authentication with each request in the header: 
  
    * `apiAccessKeyId` 
    * `apiSecretAccessKey`
    * `entityId` or `entityName` (Only for [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity ""Multi-entity""). See ""Entity Id and Entity Name"" below for more information.)

  * Use an authorization cookie. The cookie authorizes the user to make calls to the REST API for the duration specified in  **Administration > Security Policies > Session timeout**. The cookie expiration time is reset with this duration after every call to the REST API. To obtain a cookie, call the REST  `connections` resource with the following API user information: 
  
    *   ID    
    *   password
    *   entity Id or entity name (Only for [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity ""Multi-entity""). See ""Entity Id and Entity Name"" below for more information.) 
    
  * For CORS-enabled APIs only: Include a 'single-use' token in the request header, which re-authenticates the user with each request. See below for more details.

### Entity Id and Entity Name

The `entityId` and `entityName` parameters are only used for [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity ""Zuora Multi-entity"").


The  `entityId` and `entityName` parameters specify the Id and the [name of the entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/B_Introduction_to_Entity_and_Entity_Hierarchy#Name_and_Display_Name ""Introduction to Entity and Entity Hierarchy"") that you want to access, respectively. Note that you must have permission to access the entity. 

You can specify either the `entityId` or `entityName` parameter in the authentication to access and view an entity.

  * If both `entityId` and `entityName` are specified in the authentication, an error occurs. 
  * If neither `entityId` nor `entityName` is specified in the authentication, you will log in to the entity in which your user account is created. 
  

To get the entity Id and entity name, you can use the GET Entities REST call. For more information, see [API User Authentication](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/A_Overview_of_Multi-entity#API_User_Authentication ""API User Authentication"").
  
  ### Token Authentication for CORS-Enabled APIs
  
  The CORS mechanism enables REST API calls to Zuora to be made directly from your customer's browser, with all credit card and security information transmitted directly to Zuora. This minimizes your PCI compliance burden, allows you to implement advanced validation on your payment forms, and  makes your payment forms look just like any other part of your website.
  
For security reasons, instead of using cookies, an API request via CORS uses **tokens** for authentication.

The token method of authentication is only designed for use with requests that must originate from your customer's browser; **it should  not be considered a replacement to the existing cookie authentication** mechanism.

See [Zuora CORS REST](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/REST_API/A_REST_basics/G_CORS_REST ""Zuora CORS REST"") for details on how CORS works and how you can begin to implement customer calls to the Zuora REST APIs. See  [HMAC Signatures](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POSTHMACSignature ""HMAC Signatures"") for details on the HMAC method that returns the authentication token.

# Requests and Responses

## Request IDs 
As a general rule, when asked to supply a ""key"" for an account or subscription (accountKey, account-key, subscriptionKey, subscription-key), you can provide either the actual ID or  the number of the entity.

## HTTP Request Body

Most of the parameters and data accompanying your requests will be contained in the body of the HTTP request. 

The Zuora REST API accepts JSON in the HTTP request body. No other data format (e.g., XML) is supported.

### Data Type

([Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions) and CRUD operations only) We recommend that you do not specify the decimal values with quotation marks, commas, and spaces. Use characters of `+-0-9.eE`, for example, `5`, `1.9`, `-8.469`, and `7.7e2`. Also, Zuora does not convert currencies for decimal values.

## Testing a Request

Use a third party client, such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se ""curl""), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com ""Postman""), or [Advanced REST Client](https://advancedrestclient.com ""Advanced REST Client""), to test the Zuora REST API.

You can test the Zuora REST API from the Zuora API Sandbox or Production tenants. If connecting to Production, bear in mind that you are working with your live production data, not sample data or test data.

## Testing with Credit Cards

Sooner or later it will probably be necessary to test some transactions that involve credit cards. For suggestions on how to handle this, see [Going Live With Your Payment Gateway](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards ""C_Zuora_User_Guides/A_Billing_and_Payments/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards""
).

## Concurrent Request Limits

Zuora enforces tenant-level concurrent request limits. See <a href=""https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits"" target=""_blank"">Concurrent Request Limits</a> for more information.



## Error Handling

Responses and error codes are detailed in [Responses and errors](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/REST_API/A_REST_basics/3_Responses_and_errors ""Responses and errors"").

# Pagination

When retrieving information (using GET methods), the optional `pageSize` query parameter sets the maximum number of rows to return in a response. The maximum is `40`; larger values are treated as `40`. If this value is empty or invalid, `pageSize` typically defaults to `10`.

The default value for the maximum number of rows retrieved can be overridden at the method level.

If more rows are available, the response will include a `nextPage` element, which contains a URL for requesting the next page.  If this value is not provided, no more rows are available. No ""previous page"" element is explicitly provided; to support backward paging, use the previous call.

## Array Size

For data items that are not paginated, the REST API supports arrays of up to 300 rows.  Thus, for instance, repeated pagination can retrieve thousands of customer accounts, but within any account an array of no more than 300 rate plans is returned.

# API Versions

The Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the API.

## Major Version

The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. Currently, Zuora only supports the **v1** major version. For example, `POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.

## Minor Version

Zuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to replace it. 

Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request header to process without an error. 

If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions. For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.

If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we note that in the field description.

You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the  `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.

For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration. 

### Minor Version History

The supported minor versions are not serial. This section documents the changes made to each Zuora REST API minor version.

The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a Zuora REST API minor version.
